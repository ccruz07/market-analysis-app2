      <h1> Bus Mall Product Survey</h1>

        <p> Message to the User</p>
        <p> Welcome the Bus Mall. The purpose of this site is to provide some information to our marketing team about some popular
          items that may be added to the new Bus Mall coming soon. Your participation in this survey is an important first step.
          Many of the items you see here, may be available in the near future.  We appreciate your opinion.
          Please click on your favorite choice, one vote for each set of three pictures. Each choice will be counted and you will see a
          final vote count at the end of the survey.   Our marketing team will collect the survey information and analyze the results.
          Thank you for your support.</p>
